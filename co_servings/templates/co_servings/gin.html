<h5 style="color:blue; margin-left: 50px;">"Stakeholders in real estate development projects use the Co-Serving "app for Dapp" platform to connect to a web3 blockchain technology, in order to promote transparency, decentralization, and community-driven development. The blockchain   helps to promote trust, accountability, and collaboration in social interactions."</h5>

<h5 style="color:blue; margin-left: 50px;"> How does'it work:</h5>
<h5 style="color:blue; margin-left: 50px;"> Step 1:&nbsp&nbspFill Up the Supply Section in Venus Protocol(VP)</h5>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h5> VP is a decentralized money market protocol on the Binance Smart Chain that enables users to lend and borrow various cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, using collateralized loans. InvestorA supplies assets to VP to earn interest on those assets. VP offers variable interest rates on supplied assets that are determined by the supply and demand for those assets on the protocol. To create Passive income: Supplying assets to VP can be a way to generate passive income without having to actively trade or invest in other assets. VP is built on the Binance Smart Chain,  a highly secure and decentralized blockchain,  where  assets "supply" are held in a secure and transparent manner.&nbspVP is designed to minimize risk for users by offering over-collateralized loans and a liquidation system that ensures that loans are fully backed at all time by collateral.</h5></div>
<h5 style="color:blue; margin-left: 50px;"> Step 2:&nbsp&nbsp InvestorB provides assets to the Borrow Section in VP</h5>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
<h5> When the VP's Supply Section  reaches the value of $15M  in BNB coin, InvestorB adds $10M to  InvestorA'Wallet to be deposited in the Borrow Section of VP. &nbsp&nbsp InvestorB gains 6% return on the borrowed capital by BorrowerC.&nbsp&nbsp <strong>InvestorB takes  6 percent return on the loaned capital, but does not share   in the profits of the project because his investment is guaranteed by the funds available in InvestorA's Wallet.</strong></h5></div>
<h5 style="color:blue; margin-left: 50px;"> Step 3:&nbsp&nbsp BorrowerC takes a $10M loan at 6% interest from Borrow Section in VP</h5> 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h5>BorrowerC selects a project type from the Catalogue and develops ProjectD. When ProjectD is finished he returns Loan+Interest to VP's Borrow Section. InvestorB can then take back his Investment+Interest from InvestorA's Wallet. BorrowerC  keeps 40% of profit and distributes 40% to InvestorA and 20% to the Co-Serving platform which managed and coded all transactions.<strong>&nbspThe property of ProjectD remains in InvestorA's Wallet untill all the smart contracts conditions are sucessfully resolved.</strong></h5></div>
<!--<h5>Decentralization: Co-Serving Dapp is built on decentralized blockchain network that eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as central authorities or middlemen, to facilitate transactions. This creates a more open and democratic system that allows users to interact with each other directly and without the need for a trusted third party. This can foster greater trust and transparency in social interactions.</h5>

<h5>Transparency: Co-Serving Dapp is often transparent, meaning that the underlying code and data are publicly accessible and auditable. This can create a level of trust and accountability that is not possible with centralized applications, where the code and data are typically owned by a single entity.</h5>

<h5>Community-driven: Co-Serving Dapp is often developed by communities of developers and users, rather than centralized organizations. This can create a more collaborative and community-driven environment where users have a say in the direction of the application and can contribute to its development.</h5>

<h5>Privacy: Co-Serving Dapp uses privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs to protect user privacy while still allowing for secure and transparent transactions. This can be particularly valuable in social contexts where privacy is important, such as  financial transactions.</h5>

<h5>Incentives: Co-Serving Dapp is built on blockchain networks that use cryptocurrency or other digital assets as a means of incentivizing users to participate in the network. This can create a more equitable system where users are rewarded for their contributions and can help to reduce the influence of centralized entities.</h5>
