<h5><small>Co-Serving operates through the following method:</small> </h5>
<h6 style="color:grey;">
▪ <u style="color:white">Collateral Capital Participation:</u>An interested Pension Fund will participate as collateral capital to support mortgage offers targeted at individuals with low income, based on social necessities.</h6>
<h6 style="color:grey;">
▪ <u style="color:white">Return Agreement:</u> The Pension Fund agrees to a 6% return on its investment over a commitment period of 40 years.</h6>
<h6 style="color:grey;">
▪ <u style="color:white">Mortgage Coverage:</u>The Pension Fund will cover 90% of the mortgage amount, providing essential capital for mortgage issuance.</h6>
<h6 style="color:grey;">
▪ <u style="color:white">Down Payment:</u>A Savings Account will provide the remaining 10% down payment to complete the mortgage package.</h6>
<h6 style="color:grey;">
▪ <u style="color:white">Savings Account Mechanics:</u>Borrowers will pay 1.5% interest on the amount borrowed from the Pension Fund.</h6>
<h6 style="color:grey;">
▪ <u style="color:white">Profit Distribution:</u> • Upon the sale of the property and full mortgage repayment plus interest of 6%, the profit from the capital gain will be distributed as follows:
• 45% to the Pension Fund
• 45% to the property owner
• 10% for co-serving expenses, which includes managing the platform and creating smart contracts.
</h6>
<!--<h6 style="color:grey;">
▪ <u style="color:white">Investors in the fund enjoy liquidity by buying and selling shares of FundCr</u> on the open market, similar to traditional closed-end funds. As with any closed-end fund, the price of the FundCr shares may trade at a premium or discount to the Net Asset Value (NAV) 
of the fund.</h6>
<h6 style="color:grey;">
To streamline this process, <u style="color:white">we incorporate permissioned private blockchain technology,</u> leveraging its transparency and security. Here's how blockchain enhances the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of FundCr while appealing to the younger generation:</h6>
<h6 style="color:orange;">
I. Instead of issuing traditional shares, FundCr distributes tokens to its shareholders. 
These tokens can be traded, providing liquidity to investors. Similar to traditional 
finance, these tokens may trade at a premium or discount to FundCr's NAV.</h6>
<h6 style="color:orange;">
II. All contracts involving lenders, borrowers, and FundCr are executed through smart 
contracts, reducing time, and cost significantly.</h6>
<h6 style="color:grey;">
<u style="color:white">It is essential to note that the Co-Serving Platform, which encompasses both the crowdfunding operation (FundCr) and permissioned private blockchain infrastructure, operates profitably.</u> We believe that Co-Serving financial system represents a transformative approach to funding sustainable projects while embracing technological advancements.</h6>

This entity, known as the design-build project provider, is responsible for the entire project from start to finish, including the design, engineering, construction, and even the management of the project.&nbsp&nbspIn this method, the Borrower_C contracts with the design-build provider to complete the project according to their specifications, and the provider is responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the project are completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of the Borrower_C.</h6><h5>Design-build project providers can be large firms, small businesses, or even individual contractors. They typically have a team of architects, engineers, and construction professionals who work together to design and build the project, and they are often chosen for their experience, expertise, and ability to deliver high-quality projects. &nbsp&nbspThe "Projects" item in the main menue of Co-Serving platform offers a list of pre-selected design-build companies to be used by Borrower_C.One of the key benefits of working with a design-build project provider is that it simplifies the project delivery process, as the project owner Borrower_C only has to deal with one entity throughout the entire project.</h5> <h6><strong style="color:grey;"><u>This can help to reduce costs, streamline communication, and minimize the risk of errors and delays.</u></strong></h6>

<h5 style="color:lightgreen"><strong><u>Investor-A's Stakeholder</u></strong></h5>&nbsp&nbsp<h5> <h6 style="color:lightgrey">Impact finance institutions are investment firms that prioritize social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. Investor_A is an impact finance institution that seeks to generate positive social and environmental outcomes through its investments while also generating financial returns for its investors.&nbsp&nbspOne of the key characteristics of impact finance investors like Investor_A is their commitment to investing in projects and companies that have a clear and measurable social and/or environmental impact. They prioritize investments that align with their values and mission, and they use a range of metrics and tools to assess the impact of their investments.&nbsp&nbspAnother key characteristic of impact finance investors is their willingness to engage with investees to help them achieve their social and environmental goals. They often provide not just financial capital, but using Co-Serving platform they also provide strategic guidance, networks, and other forms of support to help their investees succeed.&nbsp&nbspInvestor_A may find it attractive to put funds as supply capital of Venus Protocol for several reasons. First, Venus Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that is designed to provide a range of financial services, such as borrowing, lending, and trading, to users around the world.</h6> <h5> By investing in Venus Protocol, Investor_A could help to expand access to financial services and promote financial inclusion.&nbsp&nbspSecond, Venus Protocol is built on the Binance Smart Chain, which is a blockchain platform that prioritizes speed, scalability, and low transaction fees. This makes Venus Protocol an attractive option for users who want to avoid the high fees and slow transaction times associated with other blockchain platforms.&nbsp&nbspFinally, Venus Protocol has a strong focus on sustainability and social impact. The platform is designed to promote environmentally sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy sources, and it has partnered with a number of organizations to support social impact initiatives around the world.

<h5 style="color:lightgreen"><strong><u>Investor-B's Stakeholder</u></strong></h5>&nbsp&nbsp<h5> Investor-B invest in Investor-A's Wallet.&nbsp&nbspInvestor-B  enjoys several advantages by investing in Investor-A's Wallet to provide borrow funds in Venus Protocol to collect interest of 6% when Project -D is finished but having Wallet_A as collateral.</h5><h6 style="color:lightgrey">&nbsp&nbsp Firstly, by investing in Investor-A's Wallet, Investor-B could earn a stable 6% interest rate on their investment, which is a relatively high return compared to other traditional investment options, such as savings accounts or bonds. This could help Investor-B to generate passive income from their investment and diversify their investment portfolio.&nbsp&nbspSecondly, by providing funds for lending in Venus Protocol, Investor-B could help to promote financial inclusion and expand access to financial services for users around the world. This could help to promote social impact and align with Investor-B's values and mission.&nbsp&nbspThirdly, by using Wallet_A as collateral, Investor-B could mitigate the risk of default on the loan. This means that if the Borrower-C is unable to repay the loan, Investor-B would have the right to claim the collateral, which helps to reduce the risk of financial loss.&nbsp&nbspFinally, by partnering with Co-Serving, Investor-B could leverage their expertise and experience in the impact finance space. Co-Serving prioritizes companies that have a clear social and environmental impact and  have a network of partners and stakeholders that could help to support the success of the Project-D.&nbsp&nbsp<strong style="color:grey;"><u>This could help to reduce the risk of the investment and improve the chances of success.</u></strong></h6>
